			<h3>What is Substance Use Disorder?</h3>

			<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines substance use disorder, also known as drug use disorder, occur when the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both cause clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. The DSM-5 is the manual used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders. Each specific substance within the DSM-5 is addressed as a separate use disorder (e.g., alcohol use disorder, heroin use disorder, stimulant use disorder, etc.), but nearly all substances are diagnosed based on the same overarching criteria.</p>

			<p>Prior to the DSM-5, the DSM-IV categorized substance abuse and substance dependence into a single disorder measured on a continuum from mild to severe. In this overarching disorder, the criteria have not only been combined, but strengthened. For example, a diagnosis of a substance abuse previously required only one symptom. Now, mild substance use disorder in DSM-5 requires two to three symptoms from a list of 11. Additionally, the diagnosis of dependence caused much confusion. Most people link dependence with “addiction” when in fact dependence can be a normal body response to a substance.</p>

			<h3>Is substance use becoming an issue for you?</h3>
			<p>Substance use counseling is an important first step in treating substance use disorder (SUD). At Peaks Recovery Services, our cousnelors have decades of experience and will be able to offer guidance and support along your recovery journey. No matter how long you've struggled with substance use disorder or how much you use, substance abuse counseling at Peaks Recovery Services will help to make a difference in your life.<p>

			<p>Whether you are considering counseling for substance use related issues for the first time or whether you are coming out of an intensive, 30-day inpatient rehab program, we can help build a continuing, comprehensive treatment plan to help you on your recovery journey. We offer bi-weekly psych evaluations, group based counseling, trauma counseling, individual counseling sessions and random drug screening as part of our comprehensive treatment.</p>

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Services after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after inpatient rehab.</a></p>

			<p>The process for shutting off our cravings for drugs and alcohol, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>

			<p>The longer young adults participate in drug and alcohol counseling programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success for individuals who struggle with alcohol addiction and maintaing sobriety that they continue with extended care treatment. Peaks Recovery drug and alcohol counseling services allows each young adult within our program to incrementally move forward in their recovery.</p>
