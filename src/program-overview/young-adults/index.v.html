			<p>At Peaks Recovery Services we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment. The vast majority of young adults participating in 30-day residential, detox facilities will relapse within their first year and, after reflecting on the incredible relapse rate, it is apparent that more time and effort is required to stay sober.</p>
			<p>Most people abusing drugs and alcohol have invested themselves in both their substance of preference and behaviors surrounding their addiction for months, years, and even decades. Making things more problematic is the fact that 33% of alcohol abusers and 53% of drug abusers also have at least one serious mental illness. As a result, it is critical to understand that turning off both our addictive habits and mental health issues is not a light switch, time is a necessary component of becoming whole again.</p>
			<p>Studies show that the longer young adults participate in treatment programs and stay active in their recovery, the more likely it is that they will achieve long-term sobriety and stability. Those committed to treatment for one year or longer greatly reduces the chance of relapse by over 50% and is often a predictor of successful outcomes.</p>
