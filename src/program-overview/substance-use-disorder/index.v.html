<h2>What is Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
<p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines substance use disorder, also known as drug use disorder, occur when the recurrent use of alcohol, drugs, or both cause clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home. The DSM-5 is the manual used by clinicians and researchers to diagnose and classify mental disorders. Each specific substance within the DSM-5 is addressed as a separate use disorder (e.g., alcohol use disorder, heroin use disorder, stimulant use disorder, etc.), but nearly all substances are diagnosed based on the same overarching criteria.</p>
<p>Prior to the DSM-5, the DSM-IV categorized substance abuse and substance dependence into a single disorder measured on a continuum from mild to severe. In this overarching disorder, the criteria have not only been combined, but strengthened. For example, a diagnosis of a substance abuse previously required only one symptom. Now, mild substance use disorder in DSM-5 requires two to three symptoms from a list of 11. Additionally, the diagnosis of dependence caused much confusion. Most people link dependence with “addiction” when in fact dependence can be a normal body response to a substance.</p>
<h2>Why Peaks Recovery Services?</h2>
<p> Detox and inpatient facilities are the first step in the path to recovery. These facilities work to restore the brain’s natural equilibrium in a safe, medical setting. Peaks Recovery Services has many resources to connect both you and your loved one to a number of trusted detox/ inpatient facilities both nationwide and across the state of Colorado to help you find the right program for this first step.</p>
<p> Statistically, however, 77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment. Inpatient rehab is a necessary component of long-term recovery, but it is not enough. Though the drugs are gone, a façade generally lingers. People pickup drugs for many reasons, the smallest of which is to be cool or fit in. Depression, anxiety, fear, shame, guilt, trauma, and many other causes can lead a person toward the pleasure induced states that drugs promise. Sifting through the many causes for drug abuse takes time.</p>
<p>The longer adults participate in treatment programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Services we employ a variety of fully licensed professionals who both understand the nature of addiction and have been working with individuals and their substance use disorder for decades. We invite you to continue your recovery journey with us in beautiful Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p>
