<p>The costs associated with addiction are astounding for both the family and businesses at large. The economic impact of drug abuse in the United States exceeds $200 billion per year with the majority of that money being lost in worker productivity, incarceration, and premature death. The costs associated with replacing an annual salary for a high-turnover, low paying position costs about 16% of that employee’s total salary. To replace a highly educated, executive position costs the company just over 200% of that employee’s annual salary.</p>
<p>When an executive of a company has a substance use disorder, it becomes increasingly difficult to address for a number of reasons. Their positions often protect them from many of the consequences generally associated with addiction. Alcohol or drug impaired professionals or behaviorally impaired professionals are usually very intelligent, strong willed, high achievers. But they have developed patterns of living that are not congruent with their professional life.</p>
