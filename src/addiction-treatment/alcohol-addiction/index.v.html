			<h3>Is alcohol becoming an issue for you?</h3>
			<p>Alcohol counseling is an important first step in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD). At Peaks Recovery Services, our cousnelors have decades of experience and will be able to offer guidance and support along your recovery journey. No matter how long you've struggled with alcoholism or how much you drink, alcohol counseling at Peaks Recovery Services will help to make a difference in your life.<p>

			<p>Whether you are considering alcohol counseling for the first time or whether you are coming out of an intensive, 30-day inpatient rehab program, we can help build a continuing, comprehensive treatment plan to help you on your recovery journey. We offer bi-weekly psych evaluations, group based counseling, trauma counseling, individual counseling sessions and random drug screening as part of our comprehensive treatment.</p>

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Services after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after inpatient rehab.</a></p>

			<p>The process for shutting off our cravings for alcohol, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing alcohol, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe that long-term recovery requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>

			<p>The longer individuals participate in drug and alcohol counseling programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success for individuals who struggle with alcohol addiction and maintaing sobriety that they continue with extended care treatment. Peaks Recovery drug and alcohol counseling services allows each individual within our program to incrementally move forward in their recovery.</p>

			<h3>General Alcohol Statistics and Effects</h3>

			<p>Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused substance in the United States. Not many people are unaware of the short and long-term consequences of drinking. Several studies have pointed to the fact that alcohol in moderation can in fact be positive for your health. Moderate alcohol drinking is considered to be no more than two, 12 ounce beers or two, 4 ounce glasses of wine, or two, 1.5 ounce shot of a distilled spirit.</p>

			<p>There are nearly 140 million current drinkers in the United States who enjoy the short term effects of relaxation and reduced inhibition. Although these effects may be pleasant, alcohol is a depressant and with a enough use can lower concentration, reflex and response time leading to poor coordination, all of which result in the slowing down of the brain. Any short term-effect of alcohol can also be amplified when taken in conjunction with other drugs like cocaine.</p>

			<p>Alcohol becomes most problematic when the body and mind are subjected to long-periods of usage and binge drinking. Effects that follow in conjunction with misuse include:</p>

			<br>
			<p>Effects on the Heart:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cardiomyopathy – Stretching and drooping of heart muscle</li>
				<li>Arrhythmias – Irregular heart beat</li>
				<li>Stroke</li>
				<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<p>Effects on the Liver:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Steatosis, or fatty liver</li>
				<li>Alcoholic Hepatitis</li>
				<li>Fibrosis</li>
				<li>Cirrhosis</li>
			</ul>

			<br>
			<p>Pancrease: Alcohol causes the pancreas to produce toxic substances that can eventually lead to pancreatitis, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas that prevents proper digestion.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Long-term alcohol consumption has been known to increase likelihood of developing cancer of the:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mouth</li>
				<li>Esophagus</li>
				<li>Throat</li>
				<li>Liver</li>
				<li>Breast</li>
			</ul>

			<p><a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/overview-alcohol-consumption/alcohol-facts-and-statistics" target="_blank">In 2010, alcohol misuse cost the United States economy $249 billion</a>. 75% of that cost was directly related to binge drinking. Nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol related causes annually. In 2014, alcohol related driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths or 31% of traffic fatalities.</p>
