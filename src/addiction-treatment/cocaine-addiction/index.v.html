			<h3>Effects of Cocaine</h3>
			<p>Like both heroin and meth, the experiential effect that follows cocaine use is due to an increase in dopamine levels within the brain. The immidiate effects of cocaine depend on the method of use e.g. snorted, inhaled, or injected. The faster the drug is absorbed, the more intense the resulting high. However, the duration of the resulting high is reduced by how quickly it is absorbed. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-short-term-effects-cocaine-use">Snorting cocaine, for example, results in a 15-30 minute high whereas smoking cocaine results in a 10-15 minute high</a>. This catch-22 effect results in greater usage and higher costs associated with getting high.</p>
			<p>Cocaine usage is associated with both desired and undesired effects. The desired effects include feeling euphoric, energetic, mentally alert, and hypersensative to sight, sound, and touch. Shot-term side effects may include reduced need for food and sleep; constricted blood vessels; dialated pupils; and increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Feelings of irritability, relentlessness, anxiety, panic, and paranoia may also follow. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-are-short-term-effects-cocaine-use" target="_blank">Severe medical complications are also associated with cocaine use</a>. Most of these medical complications are associated with the cardiovascular system, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks; neurological effects, including headaches, seizures, strokes, and coma. Sudden death may also occur in some instances and drug overdose kills nearly 6000 people every year.</p>

			<h3>Cocaine usage and young adults 18-25</h3>
			<p>In 2014 there was an estimated 1.5 million current cocaine users aged 12 and older within the United States. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/cocaine/what-scope-cocaine-use-in-united-states" target="_blank">Adults aged 18-25 have a higher rate of current cocaine use than any other group</a>. According to the NSDUH, about 913,000 Americans met the DSM-5 criteria for dependence or abuse of cocaine during the past 12 months. Nearly 40% of all drug misuse or abuse related emergency department visits involved cocaine recorded in a 2011 study. <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/side-effects-cocaine-risk-sudden-death-quadrupled-cocaine-users-314166" target="_blank">Another study</a> out of Spain shows that, when compared to the general population, those that had recently used cocaine had sudden death rates between 13-58% times higher.</p>

			<h3>Cocaine usage and Professionals</h3>
			<h3>Peaks Services can help you recover from Cocaine Addiction</h3>
			<p>Detox and inpatient facilities are the first step in the path to recovery. These facilities work to restore the brain’s natural equilibrium in a safe, medical setting. Peaks Recovery Services have many resources to connect either you or your loved one to a number of trusted detox/ inpatient facilities both nationwide and across the state of Colorado to help you find the right program for heroin/ opiate addiction.</p>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment</a>. Inpatient rehab is a necessary component of long-term recovery, but it is not a silver bullet. Though the drugs are gone, a façade generally lingers. People use drugs for a variety of reasons, the smallest of which is to be cool or fit in. Depression, anxiety, fear, works stress, shame, guilt, trauma, and many other causes can lead a person toward the pleasure induced states that drugs promise. Sifting through the many causes for drug abuse takes time.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults and professionals participate in treatment programs, while actively participating in their recovery journey outside the clinical setting, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapses rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success of the individual that the continue with extended clinical services.</p>
