			<h3>Is cocaine becoming an issue for you?</h3>
			<p>Counseling for cocaine addiction is an important first step in treating substance use disorder (SUD). At Peaks Recovery Services, our cousnelors have decades of experience and will be able to offer guidance and support along your recovery journey. No matter how long you've struggled with cocaine addiction or how much you use, cocaine counseling at Peaks Recovery Services will help to make a difference in your life.<p>

			<p>Whether you are considering counseling for cocaine related issues for the first time or whether you are coming out of an intensive, 30-day inpatient rehab program, we can help build a continuing, comprehensive treatment plan to help you on your recovery journey. We offer bi-weekly psych evaluations, group based counseling, trauma counseling, individual counseling sessions and random drug screening as part of our comprehensive treatment.</p>

			<h3>Why Peaks Recovery Services after inpatient rehab?</h3>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year after inpatient rehab.</a></p>

			<p>The process for shutting off our cravings for cocaine and other stimulants, including the process for turning on important coping mechanisms to alleviate on going mental health issues, is not a light switch. Most people abusing cocaine and other stimulants, those neglecting their mental health, or both, have invested themselves in those behaviors for months, years, and even decades. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe that long-term recovery from cocaine addiction requires a significant investment to heal both our mind and body from our unhealthy past.</p>

			<p>The longer individuals participate in drug and alcohol counseling programs and actively participate in their recovery journey, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapse rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Recovery Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success for individuals who struggle with cocaine addiction and maintaing sobriety that they continue with extended care treatment. Peaks Recovery drug and alcohol counseling services allows each individual within our program to incrementally move forward in their recovery.</p>

			<h3>Cocaine usage and young adults 18-25</h3>
			<p>In 2014 there was an estimated 1.5 million current cocaine users aged 12 and older within the United States. Adults aged 18-25 have a higher rate of current cocaine use than any other group. According to the NSDUH, about 913,000 Americans met the DSM-5 criteria for dependence or abuse of cocaine during the past 12 months. Nearly 40% of all drug misuse or abuse related emergency department visits involved cocaine recorded in a 2011 study. Another study out of Spain shows that, when compared to the general population, those that had recently used cocaine had sudden death rates between 13-58% times higher.</p>

			<h3>Effects of Cocaine</h3>
			<p>Like both heroin and meth, the experiential effect that follows cocaine use is due to an increase in dopamine levels within the brain. The immediate effects of cocaine depend on the method of use e.g. snorted, inhaled, or injected. The faster the drug is absorbed, the more intense the resulting high. However, the duration of the resulting high is reduced by how quickly it is absorbed. Snorting cocaine, for example, results in a 15-30 minute high whereas smoking cocaine results in a 10-15 minute high. This catch-22 effect results in greater usage and higher costs associated with getting high.</p>

			<p>Cocaine usage is associated with both desired and undesired effects. The desired effects include feeling euphoric, energetic, mentally alert, and hypersensitive  to sight, sound, and touch. Shot-term side effects may include reduced need for food and sleep; constricted blood vessels; dilated pupils; and increased body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. Feelings of irritability, relentlessness, anxiety, panic, and paranoia may also follow. Severe medical complications are also associated with cocaine use. Most of these medical complications are associated with the cardiovascular system, including disturbances in heart rhythm and heart attacks; neurological effects, including headaches, seizures, strokes, and coma. Sudden death may also occur in some instances and drug overdose kills nearly 6000 people every year.</p>
