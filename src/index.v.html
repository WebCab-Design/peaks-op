		<h3>Dual Diagnosis Treatment</h3>
		<p>Dual Diagnosis refers to individuals who struggle with both a mental illness and substance use disorder. Often times, mental health issues are the root causes for prolonged substance use. By addressing the underlying issues of the substance use disorder, treatment becomes more effective and individuals are able to develop longer, more reliable coping mechanisms in the process.</p>
