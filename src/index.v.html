		<h3>Dual Diagnosis Counseling</h3>
		<p>Dual Diagnosis refers to individuals who struggle with both a mental illness and substance use disorder. Often times, mental health issues are the root causes for prolonged substance use. By addressing the underlying issues of the substance use disorder, treatment becomes more effective and individuals are able to develop longer, more reliable coping mechanisms in the process.</p>

	<h3>Why therapy at Peaks Recovery Services?</h3>
	<p>Outpatient therapy can help you regulate negative emotions that may arise out of the many challenges and stressors you may face at home, work, or at school; even if they aren't dramatically life-altering or traumatic.
