			<h3>Effects of Heroin?</h3>
			<p><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/heroin/what-are-immediate-short-term-effects-heroin-use" target="_blank">Heroin is</a> an opioid pain killer taken recreationally for its euphoric effects. People have natural opioid receptors throughout the body and brain. Once heroin enters the brain, it is converted to morphine and binds rapidly to opioid receptors. When opioids bind to these receptors they decrease the body’s perception of pain, elevating mood by increasing dopamine levels. Heroin floods the opioid receptors while simultaneously reducing the amount of GABA inhibitory interneurons. Normally, GABA reduces the amount of dopamine released. By inhibiting this inhibitor, opioids ultimately produce enormously high levels of dopamine and, thus, the euphoric effects that follow.</p>

			<p>Studies have also shown that after prolonged periods of heroin usage serotonin levels diminish significantly compared to healthy individuals. Serotonin receptors work similarly to GABA receptors by reducing the amount of dopamine. Dopamine essentially drives cravings and serotonin applies the brakes, so to speak. As serotonin levels decrease it becomes harder for the addicted person to realize enough-is-enough or become satiated.</p>

			<p>The chemical imbalance within the brain caused by heroin can quickly lead to dependence and eventually addiction, especially after long-term use.</p>

			<h3>Heroin Addiction and Young Adults</h3>
			<p>Heroin use over the past decade has more than doubled among young adults ages 18-25. Historically, the average age in which individuals died from heroin overdoses was between 40 and 50. Now, however, the average age of deaths related to heroin is between 18 and 25. 90% of heroin users are middle-class, Caucasian individuals.</p>

			<h3>Heroin Addiction and Professionals</h3>
			<p>It's not just limited to young adults, either. Brilliant, educated and successful professionals are falling prey to the ravages of heroin. On February 2, 2013, America was stunned with the heroin overdose death of 46-year-old Oscar-winning Philip Seymour Hoffman. The year before, Hoffman had entered rehab due to an addiction to prescription painkillers, but eventually switched to heroin.</p>

			<p><em>"It's hard to talk about the heroin problem without talking about the prescription drug (pain pill) problem,"</em> said White House Office of National Drug Control Policy Rafael Lemaitre. As it becomes even more popular, we could well see heroin become the narcotic of choice of younger and older abusers.</p>

			<h3>Peaks Services can help you recover from Heroin/ Opiate Addiction</h3>
			<p>Detox and inpatient facilities are the first step in the path to recovery. These facilities work to restore the brain’s natural equilibrium in a safe, medical setting. Peaks Recovery Services have many resources to connect either you or your loved one to a number of trusted detox/ inpatient facilities both nationwide and across the state of Colorado to help you find the right program for heroin/ opiate addiction.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">Statistically, 77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment</a>. Inpatient rehab is a necessary component of long-term recovery, but it is not a silver bullet. Though the drugs are gone, a façade generally lingers. People use drugs for a variety of reasons, the smallest of which is to be cool or fit in. Depression, anxiety, fear, works stress, shame, guilt, trauma, and many other causes can lead a person toward the pleasure induced states that drugs promise. Sifting through the many causes for drug abuse takes time.</p>

			<p>The longer young adults and professionals participate in treatment programs, while actively participating in their recovery journey outside the clinical setting, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapses rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success of the individual that the continue with extended clinical services.</p>
