			<h3>Effects of Alcohol</h3>
			<p>Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused substance in the United States. Not many people are unaware of the short and long-term consequences of drinking. <a href="http://drugabuse.com/library/the-effects-of-alcohol-use/" target="_blank">Several studies</a> have pointed to the fact that alcohol in moderation can in fact be positive for your health. Moderate alcohol drinking is considered to be no more than two, 12 ounce beers or two, 4 ounce glasses of wine, or two, 1.5 ounce shot of a distilled spirit.</p>
			<p>There are nearly 140 million current drinkers in the United States who enjoy the short term effects of relaxation and reduced inhibition. Although these effects may be pleasant, alcohol is a depressant and with enough use can lower concentration, reflex and response time leading to poor coordination, all of which result in the slowing down of the brain. Any short term-effect of alcohol can also be amplified when taken in conjunction with other drugs like cocaine.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health/alcohols-effects-body" target="_blank">Alcohol becomes most problematic when the body and mind are subjected to long-periods of usage and binge drinking</a>. Effects that follow in conjunction with misues include:</p>
			<p><strong>Effects on the Heart:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cardiomyopathy – Stretching and drooping of heart muscle</li>
				<li>Arrhythmias – Irregular heart beat</li>
				<li>Stroke</li>
				<li>High Blood Pressure</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Effects on the Liver:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Steatosis, or fatty liver</li>
				<li>Alcoholic Hepatitis</li>
				<li>Fibrosis</li>
				<li>Cirrhosis</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Pancrease:</strong> Alcohol causes the pancreas to produce toxic substances that can eventually lead to pancreatitis, a dangerous inflammation and swelling of the blood vessels in the pancreas that prevents proper digestion.
			Long-term alcohol consumpiton has been known to increase likilihood of developing cancer of the:
			<ul>
				<li>Mouth</li>
				<li>Esophagus</li>
				<li>Throat</li>
				<li>Liver</li>
				<li>Breast</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a href="https://www.verywell.com/how-many-people-drink-alcohol-in-the-us-67305" target="_blank">In 2010, alcohol misuse cost the United States economy  49 billion</a>. 75% of that cost was direclty related to binge drinking. Nearly 88,000 people die from alcohol related causes annually. In 2014, alcohol related driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths or 31% of traffic fatalities.</p>

			<h3>Alcohol Use and Young Adults 18-25</h3>
			<p>Between the ages of 18-25 there are 20.78 million current alcohol users. 13.1 million of these users are binge drinkers and 3.74 million are heavy drinkers.</p>
			<p>In 2014, 16.3 million adults aged 18 or older met criteria for Alcohol Disorder in the United States. Only about 1.5 million of them actually received treatment.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/812231.pdf" target="_blank">The highest percentage of fatal crashes are between the ages of 21-24</a>, accounting for 30% of the 9,967 deaths among traffic fatalities.</p>

			<h3>Alcohol Use and Professionals</h3>
			<h3>Peaks Services can help you recover from Heroin Addiction</h3>
			<p>Detox and inpatient facilities are the first step in the path to recovery. These facilities work to restore the brain’s natural equilibrium in a safe, medical setting. Peaks Recovery Services have many resources to connect either you or your loved one to a number of trusted detox/ inpatient facilities both nationwide and across the state of Colorado to help you find the right program for heroin/ opiate addiction.</p>
			<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">Statistically, 77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment</a>. Inpatient rehab is a necessary component of long-term recovery, but it is not a silver bullet. Though the drugs are gone, a façade generally lingers. People use drugs for a variety of reasons, the smallest of which is to be cool or fit in. Depression, anxiety, fear, works stress, shame, guilt, trauma, and many other causes can lead a person toward the pleasure induced states that drugs promise. Sifting through the many causes for drug abuse takes time.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults and professionals participate in treatment programs, while actively participating in their recovery journey outside the clinical setting, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapses rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success of the individual that the continue with extended clinical services. </p>
