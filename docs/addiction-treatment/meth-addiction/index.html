			<h3>Effects of Methamphetamines</h3>
			<p>Methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system. It is a derivative of the drug amphetamine. Like amphetamine, methamphetamine causes increased activity and talkativeness, decreased appetite, and a pleasurable sense of well-being or euphoria. Methamphetamine differs in that it is a far more potent stimulant in that larger amounts of it make it to the brain than your typical amphetamine used for ADHD or narcolepsy. Meth also lasts for far longer periods leading to more harmful effects on the central nervous system.</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/crystalmeth/the-stages-of-the-meth-experience.html" target="_blank">There are seven</a> phases associated with using methamphetamine. The first is known as the rush. Methamphetamine rush includes increased heart rate, blood pressure, and metabolism. The rush can continue for up to thirty minutes.</p>
			<p>The second stage is the actual high or sometimes referred to as the shoulder. During this stage the abuser often feels aggressively smarter and may be overly argumentative, quick to interrupt others and finish their sentences. This delusional effect can result in the user becoming intently focused on insignificant items such as excessively cleaning windows. The high, depending on dosage and user, can last anywhere from four to sixteen hours.</p>
			<p>The third stage is known as the binge and refers to the user desiring both a continued rush and high. The binge can last anywhere from three to fifteen days. With every inhalation or injection the user experiences another rush and high, but ultimately after continued use the rush and high effects become diminished until there is no rush or high.</p>
			<p>The fourth stage is known as tweaking and is the most dangerous stage for the user. At this stage he or she are no longer able to relieve the horrible feelings of emptiness and craving associated with the inability to get high again. Their sense of identity becomes diminished followed by intense itching and the feeling of having bugs crawling underneath the skin. The person is also unable to sleep and may be awake for several days at a time. The user is in a complete psychotic state. Hallucinations escalate and further disconnects him or her from reality resulting in hostility toward self and others. The potential for self-mutilation is high.</p>
			<p>The fifth stage is known as the crash. In this stage the body literally shuts down resulting in long periods of sleep for the person. Many individuals appear lifeless during this stage.</p>
			<p>After the crash, the abuser returns in a deteriorated state, starved, dehydrated, and utterly exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. This phase can last between two and fourteen days.</p>
			<p>Finally, there is withdrawal. The solution to the prior phase is to take more meth. Thirty to ninety days can pass after the last drug use before the abuser realizes that he or she is in withdrawal. <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/faces-crystal-meth-shocking-before-7260592" target="_blank">The effects can leave a person uncrecognizable</a>. 93% of methamphetamine users will relapse after treatment.</p>

			<h3>Methamphetamine Addiction and Young Adults</h3>
			<p>Though methampethatimne is highly addictive, it is generally one of the least used substances among young adults. <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/methamphetamine" target="_blank">About 3% of all young adults 18-25 will try meth within their lifetime</a>. 1% of young adults used meth within the last year and only 1/5th of 1% have used within the last month during the time of study.</p>
			<p>Even if methamphetamine is not widely used, it is still widely available. In a 2008 <a href="http://www.crchealth.com/troubled-teenagers/teenage-substance-abuse/adolescent-substance-abuse/meth-use-among-youth/" target="_blank">study</a> 45% of young adults reported the drug being accessible and 30% reported that the drug had been directly offered to them. 20% of teenagers believe there is no risk in at least trying the drug. And though meth use is on the decline for young adults in general, it is still important to note that some young adults will start using meth and given its highly addictive potential, treatment may be necessary to undo the dependency.</p>

			<h3>Methamphetamine Addiction and Professionals</h3>
			<h3>Peaks Services can help you recover from Heroin Addiction</h3>
			<p>Detox and inpatient facilities are the first step in the path to recovery. These facilities work to restore the brain’s natural equilibrium in a safe, medical setting. Peaks Recovery Services have many resources to connect either you or your loved one to a number of trusted detox/ inpatient facilities both nationwide and across the state of Colorado to help you find the right program for heroin/ opiate addiction.</p>
			<p>Statistically, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/craving/201402/how-often-do-long-term-sober-alcoholics-and-addicts-relapse" target="_blank">77% of individuals will relapse within their first year of treatment</a>. Inpatient rehab is a necessary component of long-term recovery, but it is not a silver bullet. Though the drugs are gone, a façade generally lingers. People use drugs for a variety of reasons, the smallest of which is to be cool or fit in. Depression, anxiety, fear, works stress, shame, guilt, trauma, and many other causes can lead a person toward the pleasure induced states that drugs promise. Sifting through the many causes for drug abuse takes time.</p>
			<p>The longer young adults and professionals participate in treatment programs, while actively participating in their recovery journey outside the clinical setting, the more likely it is that they will receive long-term sobriety and stability. One year of sobriety reduces relapse rates by over 50%. Two years of sobriety reduces relapses rates by nearly 85%. At Peaks Services we believe it paramount to the long-term success of the individual that the continue with extended clinical services.</p>
